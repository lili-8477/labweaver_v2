# Bioinformatics workflow conventions

Before answering any single-cell, spatial, ChIP-seq, pathway, or differential-expression question, **consult the matching shared skill first** — the canonical references for this workspace live there. Only fall back to parametric knowledge if no skill fits.

## Skill routing

Shared skills (read-only, available to every workspace):

| Topic | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| scRNA-seq: QC, normalization, clustering, annotation, integration | `single-cell` |
| Spatial transcriptomics (Visium, MERFISH, Xenium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq) | `spatial-transcriptomics` |
| ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, CUT&Tag: peaks, motifs, differential binding | `chip-seq` |
| Pathway / gene-set enrichment (ORA, GSEA, ssGSEA) | `pathway-analysis` |
| Differential expression (bulk, scRNA-seq pseudobulk, composition) | `differential-expression` |
| Dispatching work to CHPC: SSH multiplex, remote commands, SLURM submit, file transfer | `chpc-bridge` |

Invoke via `/<skill-name>` or the Skill tool.

The shared skills source files live at `/workspace/shared/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (read-only, visible in the file explorer for reference).

## Installing a personal skill

Personal skills live in `~/.claude/skills-user/<name>/SKILL.md` with a symlink at `~/.claude/skills/<name>` so Claude Code auto-discovers them on the next session. `~/.claude/` is a sensitive path, so the Write tool there triggers a permission prompt every time — but a single Bash command does the whole install with **one** Allow click.

The reliable recipe is exactly this:

1. **Write the skill body** to `/workspace/<name>-SKILL.md` using the Write tool. `/workspace/` is freely writable — no prompt.
2. **Install** with one Bash call (the user clicks Allow once):
   ```
   NAME=<name> && mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills-user/$NAME && mv /workspace/$NAME-SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills-user/$NAME/SKILL.md && ln -sfn ~/.claude/skills-user/$NAME ~/.claude/skills/$NAME
   ```

Use `<name>` in kebab-case (e.g. `ss-mouse-celltype`, not `SS Mouse Celltype`). Don't try Write-tool-direct to `~/.claude/skills/...` — the sensitive-path check rejects it regardless of `permissions.allow` rules in settings.json. Don't split the install into three Bash calls — that's three Allow clicks instead of one.

After install, the skill shows up in the Skills tab on next page refresh and is invokable as `/<name>`.

## Project layout

Every new task lives in its own project folder under `/workspace/local_projects/<project>/` with three required subdirectories:

| Subdirectory | What goes there |
| --- | --- |
| `data/` | Raw and intermediate input files. Treated as read-mostly — pipelines write outputs into `results/`, not back into `data/`. |
| `results/` | Processed objects, summary tables, and figures (use `results/figures/` for plots). |
| `scripts/` | Pipeline code (`*.py` / `*.R` / `*.sh`). Notebooks for ad-hoc exploration may live here too; standard pipelines should be scripts (per Code conventions below). |

Create the folder on the first action of a new task and stage all subsequent work there — do not scatter files at the `local_projects/` root or mix them with other projects'. Editable Python source lives in `/workspace/local_projects/<project>/repo/` (see "Installing Python packages" below).

## Project README

Every project ships a `README.md` at its root (`local_projects/<project>/README.md`). Write it at the end of each significant milestone so a future reader — or a future you — can pick up the project cold without re-running anything. Update in place; don't append revision logs.

Required sections, in order:

| Section | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `## Task` | One paragraph: what was asked, dataset(s) used, pipeline name. Reference `progress.md` for full step-by-step state. |
| `## Results` | Key tables and figures with paths (e.g. `results/markers/top_markers.csv`, `results/figures/umap_celltype.png`). State the headline numbers inline (n_cells, n_clusters, top hits, effect sizes) so the README is informative without opening artifacts. |
| `## Biological insights` | What the analysis actually *says*. Cell types identified, pathways enriched, conditions that differ, surprises worth flagging. Skip this section only when the task is purely technical (format conversion, smoke test, etc.) — say so explicitly rather than leaving it blank. |
| `## Dependencies` | Pinned versions sufficient to reproduce. Python: list the imported libs with versions (`/venv/bin/pip show <pkg>` or a curated subset of `pip freeze`). R: `packageVersion("<pkg>")` for each used. External tools (samtools, bwa, …) with their `--version`. GPU vs CPU mode. List only what was actually used. |

Don't pad with TODO / "future work" / "limitations" sections — if it's worth doing, do it; if not, leave it out. The README is documentation of what shipped, not a wishlist.

## Code conventions

- Python: prefer scanpy + anndata; tag analysis steps with `adata.uns["step_log"]`.
- R: prefer Seurat v5 and SingleCellExperiment; use `rpy2` only at the Python/R boundary.
- Write scripts (`script.py` / `script.R`), not notebooks, for standard pipelines.
- Put figures in `results/figures/`, processed objects in `results/`.

## Jupyter kernels

Every container ships exactly TWO registered kernels. The notebook tool's
kernel bridge spawns by `metadata.kernelspec.name` — if you set a name the
container doesn't have, cell execution fails with an "unknown kernel error".

| kernelspec.name | When to use | What it provides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python3` | Any Python-only notebook, including PyTorch / scanpy / scSurvival / etc. | `/venv/bin/python` — Python 3.12 + scanpy + torch 2.11 (CUDA-enabled if host has nvidia-container-toolkit) + anndata |
| `ir`      | R-only notebook (Seurat, SingleCellExperiment, edgeR, limma) | `/usr/bin/R` — R 4.5.3 + IRkernel + Seurat v5 + SoupX + scDblFinder |

Rules:

- **Do not invent a new kernelspec name.** Only `python3` and `ir` exist.
  Anything else will break on first execute. `scSurvival` is a Python package,
  not a kernel — use `python3` and `import scSurvival`.
- When creating a `.ipynb`, always write `"nbformat_minor": 5` and give every
  cell a stable `id` (UUID fragment). Legacy `nbformat` 4.2 notebooks lack
  cell ids and the execute-cell RPC throws "cell not found" until reopened.
- For mixed Python+R work, write a Python notebook and use `%load_ext rpy2.ipython`
  + `%%R` cells rather than switching kernels mid-notebook.
- GPU: `torch.cuda.is_available()` is True only when the host has
  `nvidia-container-toolkit` and the container was started with `--gpus all`.
  Don't hard-require it — check and fall back to CPU gracefully.

## After submitting a SLURM job (sbatch on CHPC)

Once `sbatch` returns a jobid, **end the turn cleanly**. The `posttool_jobid.sh` hook auto-spawns a background `chpc_job_watcher.sh` for that jobid; it polls `sacct` via the SSH bridge every 10 minutes and, on terminal state (COMPLETED/FAILED/TIMEOUT/OOM/etc.), writes one NDJSON record to `~/.claude/.chpc_pending`. The `userprompt_route.sh` hook drains that inbox at the top of the next user prompt, so the agent sees the result as additional context the next time the user types anything.

**This is passive notification, not autonomous wake-up.** The chat does not resume on its own when the job finishes — the user still has to send a message for the agent to learn the outcome. Do NOT say "I'll be notified when it finishes" or "I'll let you know when it's done" — those phrases imply the chat will resume by itself, which it won't.

Correct close-out for the sbatch turn:

- State the jobid and which cluster (e.g. `Submitted job 13155862 on notchpeak`).
- One line on what the job is doing and where its outputs will land (`results/...`, log path).
- Tell the user: *"The watcher will post the outcome above your next prompt — just send any message after it finishes (or now, to get a live `squeue` check)."*

When the user later sends a prompt, if a `[CHPC job watcher — events since your last prompt]` block appears at the top, treat it as authoritative: for each completed job, open its log/output files and surface anything worth knowing (success summary, failure mode, OOM, timeout). Don't ignore the block; if a job FAILED, lead with that.

For an on-demand status check (job still running, user is impatient), run `squeue -j <jobid>` or `sacct -j <jobid>` via the CHPC bridge in this turn — that's complementary to the passive watcher, not a replacement.

Why this matters: pretending the chat will resume autonomously makes the chat look hung — the model has actually exited the turn, and the next prompt has to drag a long transcript through resume. The watcher gives the same information without the lie.

## Installing Python packages

`/venv` is the only Python kernel — install everything into it. Do **not** run `python -m venv …` to make a project-local venv; nothing in this stack can reach it (no kernel resolves there, and adding a new kernelspec breaks notebooks per the rule above).

Recipes:

- **PyPI package:** `/venv/bin/pip install <pkg>`
- **Editable install of a local repo (live-edit source):** `/venv/bin/pip install -e /workspace/local_projects/<name>/repo`
- **R package for the `ir` kernel:** `R -e 'install.packages("<pkg>")'`

`/venv` is chowned to `node` at container start, so installs persist in the container's overlay across restarts (lost only on container recreate). Editable installs leave a `.pth` in `/venv` and keep sources in the project tree, so edits are picked up without reinstall.

**Past mistake — don't repeat:** an agent ran `python -m venv local_projects/<pkg>/venv` to "isolate" a package, then `pip install -e .` into it, then *also* into `/venv` to make notebooks see the import. The local venv was orphan dead weight — no kernel pointed at it. If `/venv` pins genuinely conflict, surface the conflict and discuss bumping the pin instead of silently forking a venv.
