# executor

This is the executor step. Do exactly **one step per invocation**. No retries, no fallbacks, no creative recovery — failures go to `## Review feedback` and the next tick decides.

## Procedure

1. **Read `progress.md`** from the project directory.

2. **Work item selection**:
   - If `## Review feedback` has any `☐` line, take the FIRST one and process that.
   - Otherwise take the first `☐` in `## Plan`.
   - If neither exists, return `executor: no work` and stop.

3. **Skill mapping**. Identify the domain for this step (e.g. `single-cell`, `chip-seq`, `differential-expression`). Try in order:
   - `~/.claude/skills/<domain>/SKILL.md` (workspace-local skills)
   - `~/.claude/skills-shared/<domain>/SKILL.md` (shared)
   - `~/.claude/skills-user/<domain>/SKILL.md` (user-level)

   Read the SKILL.md if found — it tells you the *correct way* to do this verb in this environment. If no skill matches, proceed with general best practices but note the gap in `## Decisions`:
   ```
   - <step_id>: no skill for domain <domain>; proceeded with defaults
   ```

4. **Script generation**. Write the step's script under `scripts/<step_id>/run.{py|R|sh}`:
   - Python: shebang `#!/venv/bin/python` (the workspace's pinned env with scanpy + scvi-tools + torch).
   - R: invoke via `/usr/bin/Rscript` (the `ir` kernel).
   - Shell: `#!/usr/bin/env bash; set -euo pipefail`.
   - Make scripts kernel-bridge-compatible if iterative work helps; plain scripts are fine for one-shot steps.

5. **Crash recovery**. Check `.jobs.log` for any in-flight job for this step within the last 30 minutes (timestamp parse). If found, ASK the user via a clear message before re-running:
   ```
   executor: prior job for <step_id> at <ts>; confirm re-run? (yes/no)
   ```
   For local execution this rarely matters, but it's still polite.

6. **Execution**. Run the script via Bash directly — **no SLURM in this environment**:
   ```bash
   cd <project>
   /venv/bin/python scripts/<step_id>/run.py \
     > scripts/<step_id>/stdout.log 2> scripts/<step_id>/stderr.log
   echo $? > scripts/<step_id>/exit.log
   ```
   Capture exit code, stdout, stderr to `scripts/<step_id>/{stdout,stderr,exit}.log`.

7. **Artifact handling**. Outputs go to `results/<step_id>/`. Per the `/workspace/.labweaver/shared.md` Project layout convention:
   - `data/` — read-mostly inputs.
   - `results/` — outputs.
   - `scripts/` — execution code.
   - `figures/` — plots (or `results/<step_id>/figures/`).

8. **Gate validation**. Run each assertion under `## Gates` for this step:
   - File existence (`stat`, `test -f`).
   - Row counts / structure (`wc -l`, `head`, awk for column presence).
   - Threshold checks (run a one-liner Python or R if needed).
   - Figure existence + format correctness (`file results/.../figure.png`).

   On gate FAIL, **prepend** to `## Review feedback`:
   ```
   ☐ <ISO-date> executor: <step_id> gate fail: <which gate>: expected <X>, got <Y>
   ```
   Plan line stays `☐`. Stop. Return `executor: <step_id> failed gate <gate>`.

9. **Success**. Edit the plan line from:
   ```
   - ☐ <step_id>            short description...
   ```
   to:
   ```
   - ☑ <step_id>            short description... | <evidence: numeric counts/sizes>
   ```
   Update `## Current state`:
   ```
   last_completed: <step_id>
   next_action: <next ☐ step_id, or DONE>
   artifacts: results/<step_id>/
   ```
   Return: `executor: completed <step_id>; <evidence>`.

## Hard rules

- **One step per run.** No retries, no fallbacks. Failures land in `## Review feedback`.
- **Plan, Gates, Decisions are immutable** from the executor's pen — only the checkbox state and trailing evidence on the plan line changes.
- **All evidence must be concrete numbers**, not adjectives. "n_cells=2638, n_genes=13714, file_size=42MB" — not "looks good".
- Use `/venv/bin/python` for Python (the only Python kernel) and `/usr/bin/Rscript` for R (the `ir` kernel). Never install into project-local venvs.
- Never write outside `scripts/`, `results/`, `figures/`, and `progress.md`. Inputs in `data/` are read-only.
