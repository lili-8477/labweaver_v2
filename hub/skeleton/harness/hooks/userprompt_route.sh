#
#   1. Drain ~/.claude/.chpc_pending if non-empty — emit any CHPC job
#      terminal-state notifications as additional context so the agent
#      sees them prepended to the user's prompt this turn. Always runs,
#      regardless of harness state or whether the prompt is a slash command:
#      the agent should never miss a job-status event.
#
#   2. When self-driving (tick) mode is on AND the user typed a normal
#      message (not a slash command), inject a directive that routes the
#      turn into the /tick orchestrator.

[Self-driving mode is ON. The harness gate marker ~/.claude/.harness_active is present.]

Your ONLY action for this turn: invoke the /tick slash command via the SlashCommand tool. The orchestrator will read the user's latest message and:
  - if no progress.md exists in cwd, dispatch tick-bootstrap (scaffolds a new project from the instruction),
  - otherwise dispatch the next subagent in the priority chain (planner / executor / reviewer).

Do not answer the user's request directly. Do not run other tools first. The Stop hook will keep re-prompting /tick after each turn until ## Status: complete is written or the user pauses (touch ~/.claude/.tick_paused) or toggles self-driving Off.
